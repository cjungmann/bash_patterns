# Bash Patterns: Sample Apps

(Back to [main][bash_patterns])

There are few examples of applications using the TUI sources.

- **bashdox**  
  This is a simple app that parses Bash scripts for functions and descriptions.

- **speed_tests**  
  Using the *test_template* script, this application runs timed executions of
  tasks using alternate strategies.

- [manlinks][manlinks]  
  Quickly access to curated *man* and *info* pages
