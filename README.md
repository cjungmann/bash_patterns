# Bash Patterns

## Introduction

This project began as a personal cheatsheet where I would warehouse
solutions and online resources.  New ideas and supporting solutions have
led to rather more emphasis on a suite of scripts that help make Bash
interactive tools.  I'm not sure what this project is, anymore, a
cheatsheet or a library.
