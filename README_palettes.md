# Project bash_patterns : paletter

[Main README](README.md)

This is a bit of a throw-away script that I used to navigate
through code and outcome possibilities in [cocolors][1]

It is an incomplete effort, without user-friendly help and
with somewhat sloppy execution.  I don't expect to improve it
unless it can be shown to serve some other useful purpose than
what it has already done.

It fails to adequately explain the output, the so-called base
colors are displayed as background colors that seem not to
honor the *intensity* color directive.  The various color labels
are not explained very well, and some of them mess up the tidy
formatting.

Other than that, enjoy.
